# Job-Posting-Analysis-with-Python
1. Data Scraping

On each individual search page, we pull job titles, company, location, and then the link to the full posting for each particular job.
In the full posting for each particular job, we scrape for job description, salary, education and experience requirements
Scraped data is stored in lists, and initial data frame is then created from those lists
The Salary and Experience columns of the data set did not contain usable data

2. Data Cleaning

To scrape experience requirement from job postings:
The job description for each job includes different experiences for different skills
All different experiences for a particular job are extracted for the maximum experience
Data frame is then created and cleaned for duplicate records and unintended spaces

Data Visualization

3. Then there is analysis with Visualization
